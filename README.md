# Well-logging-Case-study
Developed Python code to analyze digital well log (LAS) data: GR, LLD, LLS, resistivity, neutron, sonic, and density porosity, caliper logs of a well located in the NWS, Western Australia. Target formation was Brewester member within Upper Vulcan formation.Designed a Gamma ray tool for density estimation and compared it with conventional tool.
Created histograms and calculated metrics: mean, p95, p5, and standard deviation for log quality control.
Formation evaluation using shale volume using sand/shale lines and applied corrections. Estimated rwa and swa for formation and marked down reservoir zones and pay zones respectively.
Calculated porosity, water resistivity, saturation, and clay volume with interpretation.
Lithology estimation using PEF, porosity, impedance, GR, resistivity logs etc.
